# AzurLaneFleet #  
**The goal of this project**  
**Is just for easily share fleet configuration in one shot**  
  
**TBD:**  
`add sub fleet`  
`check duplicate ship/equip`  
`add import/export setting`  
  
## Rewriting site via Vue [preview](https://x94fujo6rpg.github.io/AzurLaneFleet/dev)

kind of stuck now...vue is not what i think it is  
build huge amount of element is very slow  
looks like i have to use old way to build all ship/equip when site loading to prevent blocking
